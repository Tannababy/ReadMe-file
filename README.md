## Description

In this week's challenge :star_struck:, we were tasked with creating an application that a developer can use to dynamically generate a professional README.md file, to focus more time and energy on the main project.

## Usage

![Gif of app demonstration](./assets/Demo-vid.gif)

Run node index.js in the command line of the file's directory to start the application. The application utilises inquirer to generate a series of questions to prompt the user for data.
Based off the users responses alone, the application will generate a markdown file containing the following:

- Title
- Description
- Table of Contents
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Test and
- Questions

The README will also include badges for the license.
Finally, fs.writeFile is used to generate the project's README.md file.
